        <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>Async4j is a library that provides 
callback based control flow for asynchronous 
programing model: pipe, try/catch/finaly, 
condition, foreach and even parallel foreach.
</p>
<h3>Callbacks</h3>
<p>At the heart of async4j library is the Callback interface used to 
capture the completion of asynchronous call, whatever normal or abnormal completion:
<pre><code>
public interface Callback<R>{
  public void completed(R result);
  public void error(Throwable t);
}
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
The callback interface has nothing very new, it is the well known completion event listener 
widely used in existing asynchronous interaction and generally implements the logic to be run 
on the notification of the task end. The use of callbacks from async4j differ slightly as its
implementations are intended to contain flow control logics such as those provided in this 
the library and not application logics that should be implemented in asynchronous functions 
as described in the following section.

</p>

<h3>Asynchronous function</h3>
From async4j perspective, asynchronous functions has following prototype 
<pre><code>
public void operation(Callback<R> k, P1 p1, P2 p2, ...)
</code></pre>

<p>
It takes at least one callback object as parameter that must be notified exactly one time on 
completion of the asynchronous function :
<ul>
<li><code>k.completed(R r)</code> when the function completed successluly with the asynchronous function output
passed as parameter R to the callback. This function should be call at the tail call position to have asynchronous flows 
work properly.
</li>
<li><code>k.error(Throwable e)</code> to report any exception occured during the asynchronous function execution.</li>
</ul>

The asynchronous function has no return value and must not throw any exception because both should be reported to the callback object.
The callback parameter is passed as first parameter and always named k for pratical reasons:
<ul>
<li>It serves as a clean and distinctive marker of asynchrnous fucntions</li>
<li>Let pet place to pass variable length args when need</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Asynchronous function tempale</h4>
The asynchronous code template guive some guidelines to code asynchronous fucntions
<pre><code>
public void operation(Callback<R> k, P p){
  try{
    // Application logic here
    R result = // some result value
    
    k.completed(result)
  } catch(Throwable t){ k.error(t) }
}</code></pre>
It is not recommanded to catch Throwable but need do so here to match contract for exception management as defined above 


<h3>Synchronous vs Asynchronous call</h3>
Most of asynchronous controls provided by async4j actually make use of callback stack in the same way 
synchronous function call semantics is based on call frame stacks that are transparently managed in the 
assembly or bytecode generated by the compiler. The callback object passed to the asynchronous function 
can be seen as the continuation object the same way the call frame has a return address. When the method 
<code>k.completed(R r)</code> is called at the tail position (what should be the case generally) it play
the same role as <code>return</code> instruction. Similar to the error handling with synchronous call, 
any exception reported through a callback is bubbled up to parent callbacks until it reach a callback
that implements specific handling mecanism like cacth or finally callbacks.
With these similitudes in mind, callbacks notiifcations will be named asynchronous return or asynchronous throw.
